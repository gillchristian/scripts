<h1 align="center">scripts</h1>

A set of scripts I've written (and used probably only once) to do tasks like
finding all ocurrences of different methods of a library in a project.

## Scripts

- `ramda-usage.js`:

Count all Ramda methods used in a project (only the ones of the form `R.*`). For
help on how to use it use the help flag:

```
$ node ramda-usage --help # -h also works
```
